1. N Tier Architecture
    * If you not sure how to structure applications. This course will
    teach you how to your classes in the right place.
2. Restful API with Spring MVC and the most know HTTP Methods. i.e GET,
POST, PUT, DELETE
3. Unit testing
    * Writing software is not just writing code with proving that it
    actually works.
    * You will learn how to unit test classes using JUnit, Mockito BDD
    style and Assertj.
4. How serialise and deserialise java class to JSON objects using
Jackson FasterXml
5. Spring Depedency Injection
    * Removing the new keyword for services and data access class has
    great advantages and its something that you must know.
6. JaxRS and RestEasy
    * Spring MVC is great but it does not implement JaxRS specification.

    * RestEasy makes it easy to create proxy to any API.
8. Integration Tests
    * In this course you will learn how to write integration tests to
    ensure all components and classes work together.
9. Java Bean Validation API
    * This API allows us to have annotations in Java POJOS to define
    allowed values for properties and required properties
10. Refactoring
11. How to package and spin up the application as .JAR file
